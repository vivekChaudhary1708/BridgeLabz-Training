// The University is charging the student a fee of INR 125000 for the course. The University is willing to offer a discount of 10%. Write a program to find the discounted amount and discounted price the student will pay for the course.
// Hint => 
// Create a variable named fee and assign 125000 to it.
// Create another variable discountPercent and assign 10 to it.
// Compute discount and assign it to the discount variable.
// Compute and print the fee you have to pay by subtracting the discount from the fee.
// O/P => The discount amount is INR ___ and final discounted fee is INR ___

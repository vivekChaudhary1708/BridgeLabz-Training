// Write a program to take user input for the age of all 10 students in a class and check whether the student can vote depending on his/her age is greater or equal to 18.

// Loop through the array using the length property and for the element of the array check If the age is a negative number print an invalid age and if 18 or above, print The student with the age ___ can vote. Otherwise, print The student with the age ___ cannot vote.

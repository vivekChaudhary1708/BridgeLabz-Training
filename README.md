# 🚀 BridgeLabz-Training

This repository serves as a **learning workspace for my BridgeLabz Training**, focused on building a strong foundation in **Git & GitHub, Core Java programming, and logical problem solving**.  
It documents my **day-wise learning progress**, hands-on practice, and structured code organization.



## 📂 Folder Structure

The repository is organized in a modular and clean way.  
Currently, all foundational Core Java work resides in the **core-java-practice** branch.

## 🛠️ Phase 1: Basics & Environment Setup

This phase focuses on:
- Understanding **Git & GitHub fundamentals**
- Learning **branch-based development**
- Maintaining **clean commits & folder hierarchy**
- Strengthening **Core Java basics and logic building**

---

## 📅 Day 1 – 16 December

### 🔧 Git & GitHub
- Created GitHub repository and linked it with VS Code  
- Learned basic Git commands:
  - `git add`
  - `git commit`
  - `git push`
- Understood the purpose of **version control & repositories**
- Worked with branches:
  - `main`
  - `core-java-practice`
- Learned how commits work and how code is pushed to GitHub  

### 💻 Core Java – LeetCode Practice
Solved basic Java problems to improve logic and problem-solving skills:

- ✅ Two Sum  
- ✅ Running Sum of 1D Array  
- ✅ Richest Customer Wealth  
- ✅ Palindrome Number  
- ✅ Find Numbers with Even Number of Digits  

📌 Solutions available inside **leet-code-codebase**.

## 📅 Day 2 – 17 December

### 🔧 Git & Git Bash
- Practiced Git Bash commands  
- Understood complete Git workflow  
- Used `git status` to track new and modified files  
- Used `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` effectively  
- Improved understanding of **branch-wise commits**  

### 💻 Core Java – Programming Elements

## 📅 Day 6 – 22 December 

### 💻 Core Java – Strings

Practiced **extensive String manipulation programs**, focusing on logic building using `charAt()`, loops, arrays, and exception handling.

#### Topics Covered:
- String comparison without `equals()`
- String length without `length()`
- Substring creation using `charAt()`
- Uppercase & Lowercase conversion (manual vs built-in)
- Trimming spaces without `trim()`
- Splitting text into words manually
- Finding shortest & longest words
- Vowel & consonant detection
- Character frequency (multiple approaches)
- Unique characters
- First non-repeating character
- Palindrome check (iterative, recursive, array-based)
- Anagram check
- String-based Runtime Exceptions:
  - `NullPointerException`
  - `StringIndexOutOfBoundsException`
  - `IllegalArgumentException`
  - `NumberFormatException`

📌 All string programs are available inside **gcr-codebase/strings/**.

# 🚀 BridgeLabz-Training

This repository serves as a **learning workspace for my BridgeLabz Training**, focused on building a strong foundation in **Git & GitHub, Core Java programming, and logical problem solving**.  
It documents my **day-wise learning progress**, hands-on practice, and structured code organization.



## 📂 Folder Structure

The repository is organized in a modular and clean way.  
Currently, all foundational Core Java work resides in the **core-java-practice** branch.

## 🛠️ Phase 1: Basics & Environment Setup

This phase focuses on:
- Understanding **Git & GitHub fundamentals**
- Learning **branch-based development**
- Maintaining **clean commits & folder hierarchy**
- Strengthening **Core Java basics and Control Flow concepts**



## 📅 Day 1 – 16 December

### 🔧 Git & GitHub
- Created GitHub repository and linked it with VS Code  
- Learned basic Git commands:
  - `git add`
  - `git commit`
  - `git push`
- Understood the purpose of **version control & repositories**
- Worked with branches:
  - `main`
  - `core-java-practice`
- Learned how commits work and how code is pushed to GitHub  
- Understood repository structure and folder organization  

### 💻 Core Java – LeetCode Practice
Solved basic Java problems to improve logic and problem-solving skills:

- ✅ Two Sum  
- ✅ Running Sum of 1D Array  
- ✅ Richest Customer Wealth  
- ✅ Palindrome Number  
- ✅ Find Numbers with Even Number of Digits  

📌 All Java solutions are available inside the **leet-code-codebase** folder.



## 📅 Day 2 – 17 December

### 🔧 Git & Git Bash
- Practiced Git Bash commands  
- Understood complete Git workflow  
- Used `git status` to track new and modified files  
- Used `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` effectively  
- Improved understanding of **branch-wise commits**  
- Learned how to manage repository structure properly  

### 💻 Core Java – Programming Elements

## 📅 Day 3 – 18 December

### 🔧 Git & GitHub
- Continued practicing Git & GitHub commands  
- Created and organized folders for structured learning  
- Added programs into **Level 1, Level 2, and Control Flow** folders  
- Tracked file changes using `git status`  
- Committed and pushed code using:
  - `git add`
  - `git commit`
  - `git push`
- Improved understanding of:
  - Clean commits  
  - Folder hierarchy  
  - Structured repositories  

### 💻 Core Java – Programming Elements

#### ✅ Level 1 (Basic Knowledge)
